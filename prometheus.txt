Write-up:
    First, I have installed helm on windows by downloading the suitable binary and adding it to the Enivronment path variable.
    
    Then using helm I could add repository for prometheus using the command:
        helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    
    I have strated minikube and spun up the docker and kubernetes instances.

    Next, I have installed Prometheus by running the following command:
        helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus
    This command will install Prometheus with its default configuration.
    
    To configure Prometheus for our specific needs, I will use configmaps, which are a way of providing configuration information to running pods. 
    I can see the available configmaps by running the command:
        kubectl get configmaps
    Output:
        - kube-root-ca.crt
        - prometheus-alertmanager
        - prometheus-server
        
    I can output the current configuration of a specific configmap by running the command:
        kubectl get configmap <configmap_name> -o yaml
        
    I can edit the configuration of a configmap by running the command:
        kubectl edit configmap <configmap_name>
    
    I was particularly interested in prometheus-server where the target was localhost:9090 which I changed to proxy-server:8080

    Finally, I have open the proxy-server website and went to /metrics to look at the current metrics of the data acquired by prometheus.
    Later after registering a user and causing the web application to trow a 404 error, I went back and looked at the metrics and noticed that the events were recorded.
